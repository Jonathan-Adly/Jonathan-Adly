### 🙋🏽‍♂️About Me

<p> I wear many hats depending on what is required of me but, I am first a lifelong learner. Developer, Pharmacist, Marketer, Podcaster. Jack of all trades, master of a few! Currently I am building a SaaS while learning about algorithmic e-commerce. Super interested in innovative health care technologies and will eventually will learn how to use ML/AI to make the world healthier. </p>

### 👨🏽‍💻Tech Stack

Here are a few things I've picked up along my learning journey.
</p>

- A little bit of C
